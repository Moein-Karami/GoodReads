# GoodReads
Very simple  data analysis program (I got data from GoodReads). I learned Object Orient programming through this project.

Attention: These program probably won't compile due to organization files;
you may write a new makefile to compile these programs, or just put all the .c, .cpp, .hpp, .h, and makefile to one directory.
