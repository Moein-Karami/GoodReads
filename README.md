# GoodReads
(I got data from GoodReads for this project) This is an elementary program to analyze data. It was my first opportunity to learn Object-Oriented Programming through this project.

Attention: These program probably won't compile due to organization of files;
you may write a new makefile to compile these programs, or just put all the .c, .cpp, .hpp, .h, and makefile to one directory.
