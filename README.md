# GoodReads
(I got data from GoodReads for this project) This is an elementary program to analyze data. It was my first opportunity to learn Object-Oriented Programming through this project.

Attention: Due to the organization of files, these program probably won't compile;
To compile these program, write a new makefile or put all the .c,
.cpp, .hpp, .h, and makefiles in one directory.
